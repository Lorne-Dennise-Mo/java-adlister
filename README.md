## ðŸš€ About Us
This was a team project, completed by the above authors.  We are all full-stack development students with Codeup, and we are showcasing all of the info we have learned throughout the course.  This project utilizes Java, MySQL, Bootstrap, CSS, and javascrpipt.  There was limited amount of time to complete this task, and will be continuing to improve the platform, in the future.


## Lessons Learned

This team developed a large amount of experince while working with the various Servlets and jsps, to make a functioning database become user-interactive.  We ran into many problems with functionality, but through trial-and-error, were able to accomplish the necessary requirements, as well as a few fun additions.  We have come out of this project more intelligent in understanding coding practices, and gained much needed experience.
